        <p>
            I am Johana G. Gotia, 16 years old, a Grade 12 ICT student from Escuela de Sophia of Caloocan Inc., section Pintaflores. 
            I am known as the student who joins various contests â€” from pageants to school performances. 
            In the last school year, I was a consistent honor student and actively explored new skills such as acting, singing, 
            hosting, and cooking. This year, I aim to continue growing, discovering new talents, and making the most of my senior high journey.
